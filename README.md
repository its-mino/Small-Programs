# Small-Programs
A collection of smaller programs I've created.

<h3>Commercial-Muter</h3>
Watching NFL games is fun, but commercials are very annoying. This program mutes speakers on a computer whenever the channel goes to commercial so you don't have to listen to them.

It uses the terminal command screencapture to capture an image of the screen, and checks to see if the MSNBC logo is on the screen. If the logo is not found, then a commercial is playing and the computer is muted.


<h3>Sentence-Creator</h3>
This program strings together words from a list of nouns and a list of verbs in an attempt to create sentences that follow proper grammer.
